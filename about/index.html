        I'm Camuise. <br />
        or Issac. <br />
        or whatever you know me as. <br /> <br />
        I do (hopefully) cool things with computers.
      </h1>
      <p>
        I'm a software nerd from New York. I like tinkering with computers and
        making them do fun things with code. I also really like sea animals and
        cats.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't know what else to put here. This would be where I throw in a
        picture of my cat, but I unfortunately don't have one. Would love to
        though! Maybe if you feel like being kind, you could donate to my Ko-fi
        so I can get one. Or just to support me in general. That would be cool
        too.
