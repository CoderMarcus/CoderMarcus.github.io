### Chapter 344: Ep. 64 - A Road That Isn't a Road, V

Feeding Yoo Sangah's soul to the Fourth Wall. This method was conceived based
on the past incident where my mother was eaten by the Fourth Wall. At that
time, my mother had been eaten by the wall when her soul body was damaged and
part of her soul was restored when she was spat out again. In addition, there
was the 'library' inside the Fourth Wall so it was worth trying.

Don't wa nt to. 

The Fourth Wall read my intentions but didn't listen to me. The Fourth Wall
watched the scattered Yoo Sangah and reacted furiously.

 I won't ea t th at. 

"Eat." The shock caused my body to shake. However, I didn't back down. "If you
won't eat then I'll turn off the skill."

This was my last threat. In any case, the Fourth Wall was a skill and I could
turn it off whenever I wanted. Based on previous incidents, the Fourth Wall
really hated it. Then this time...

 Do it if you c an. 

It sounded certain I couldn't do so.

 If y ou tu rn me off, the wo man can't sur vive. 

I bit my lips.

 In addi tion, turn ing me off will let the con stella tions see your in for
mation. 

\[Many constellations are paying attention to you\!\]

\[Some constellations are doubting the existence of the 'wall' you have.\]

The Fourth Wall was well aware that I was reluctant to disclose my
information. In fact, I had no useful mental barriers apart from the Fourth
Wall. If a high-grade constellation stared at me the moment the wall
disappeared, I might be as helpless as a naked baby.

I stared at the wall for a moment. "Then I will break it."

 What? 

"I will break some parts of the wall and force you to eat her."

Originally, the Fourth Wall wasn't reality. However, now I was able to hit the
wall. I clenched my fists and dealt a blow to the wall in front of me The
whole room shook from the devastating impact. There was a short scream and the
sound of people rushing outside.

I swung my fist again. The wall still had no scratches.

 It is use less. 

"..."

 It is too mu ch of a vio lation to sa ve Yoo Sang ah. 

I thought about it. As I said earlier, the Fourth Wall wasn't reality. It was
a skill I implemented. Then...

I focused my gaze towards one part of the wall. Sparks flooded the room and
Lee Jihye, who opened the door, was thrown out.

 N o\! 

There was a small crack on a corner of the Fourth Wall. It was as I expected.
Until now, I had been thinking of the skill as something that could be turned
on or off. Perhaps the 'skill' might have the appropriate intermediate state.
In other words...

What if I could turn off a 'part' of the skill? The wall rapidly cracked and a
small gap formed in an instant. There was an abyss that seemed able to swallow
anything.

Soon, the gap started to suck in the surrounding story fragments like a black
hole. The stories of Yoo Sangah were quickly sucked into the wall.

 St op...\! 

Huge sparks hit my body and I let out a terrible groan. A probability storm
was blowing through the wall. I heard the voices of the party members and my
vision turned white.

In the darkness, Yoo Sangah came to her senses. She opened her eyes to only
darkness. In this scene that didn't allow even a point of light, Yoo Sangah
suddenly realized something.

She... wasn't dead? The last scene she saw flashed through her head. There was a
probability storm and Kim Dokja's shout as he tried to save her. Then there
was a memory of being sucked into somewhere...

There was nothing she could be sure of.

Yoo Sangah checked herself from head to toe. Eyes, lips, tongue, ears, hands,
feet, knees... there wasn't a single place where sensations could be felt. it
was as if her whole body was paralyzed and her sense of movement had
completely disappeared.

Perhaps only her soul was left?

Yoo Sangah tried to calmly accept the situation. In Haruki novels, it was
common for people to become ideas. This could be enough. The dead becoming a
soul...

...Scary. It was scary to be alone in the darkness. There were no sensations in
this state. She didn't know if she existed or not. Yoo Sangah tried not to
fall into the trap of thinking as she recalled the old proposition of
philosophy.

 I think. Therefore I am. 

This was Rene Descartes' maxim. It was such a famous saying that she was
somehow ashamed to quote it. Yet for Yoo Sangah, this was her only line of
salvation. At least, she knew she existed while she thought this. Then soon
afterwards, Yoo Sangah had a frightening thought. Then was there anyone who
didn't think? If she stopped thinking in this darkness...

Therefore, Yoo Sangah kept thinking desperately. In order not to disappear,
she remembered the things that she desperately wanted to avoid.

 "Sangah." 

A voice floated in her mind, followed by a face. It was a familiar face. Her
family members before the 'scenario' came. Her father, a judge, and her older
brothers who were doctors. Her mother who was born in a wealthy family.

 "Don't do anything conspicuous." 

 "People who aren't you will see what you have." 

 "What four languages? You just have to be a cute little girl." 

Yoo Sangah watched the flowing words and smiled bitterly. To be exact, she
lost them before that.

 "...You are going to join a game company? You aren't marrying the president of
the game company?" 

Maybe she was living a 'scenario' even before the scenario started. No one
called it for a scenario but for her, it was a scenario. If a dokkaebi had
named the scenario, perhaps it would be 'Declaration of Independence'.

 "I am a new employee." 

After entering the game company and becoming independent at home, his life
changed a bit. She also met an interesting person.

 "Yoo Sangah-ssi. Do you have a mobile phone charger?" 

The man with a thin face who borrowed her charger.

 "I am an important appointment at 7 o'clock and my battery is running out."


A person who did the interview with her and who was uncooperative about
everything in the company.

 "I will attend the ceremony but I must leave at 7 o'clock." 

He was always the person to leave the company first once the work day ended.

 "I won't participate in the picnic. I hate climbing mountains the most." 

The man who seemed like a ghost and didn't exist in other people's eyes as he
stared at his smartphone.

"...Yoo Joonghyuk, that jerk died again." 

Thus, she might've done something strange as well. She put things into the
food of the boss who took projects from his subordinates or mixed pepper in
the drinks of the manager who made them run coffee errands.

 "Uwek\! What is this? Why does the coffee taste like this?" 

It was the birth of Mino Soft's historic event, which was later called the
'Break Room Incident'.

She poured pepper into the finely ground beans and felt a sense of liberation.
The company was turned upside down. It was a criminal who couldn't even be
caught by the surveillance staff.

 Yoo Sangah, I still remember. 

A company where everyone had left work. A smartphone light appeared quietly
from behind a cabinet in the break room.

 Kim Dokja was clearly there. 

No matter whether she put in pepper or salt, the light just stayed there and
tolerated her actions. It was as if the things that happened beyond the
cabinet didn't involve him.

Maybe I should've talked to him at that time. 

Why did he remain silent behind that cabinet? Why didn't he report what she
died and why did he say, "There is no one." Why did he turn the CCTV away from
the direction of the break room? Why... was he always looking at the phone with
a variety of expressions?

Her surroundings brightened and her senses started to gradually return.

\[A powerful presence doesn't allow your 'story' to fall apart.\]

\[Someone who likes to be tidy doesn't deserve your story.\]

A voice was heard from somewhere.

 \(Look, this is 'push and pull'.\) 

\(No. I think that after watching every movie that exists on Earth...\) 

\(Isn't it a desire to become one?\) 

Yoo Sangah slowly opened her eyes and found three beings surrounding her.
There was a squid-like creature wearing glasses. An elderly man with grey hair
and a bent back. Finally, a beautiful person who exuded a strange atmosphere
where the gender was unknown.

The moment she saw the last existence, Yoo Sangah shot up with surprise.

 \(You...? \) 

 \(You woke up, new librarian,\) 

The neutral beauty, Nirvana smiled. Yoo Sangah didn't know what was going on.
Why was this person here?

Nirvana looked at her and spoke.  \(It is a long explanation. You'll find out
soon. You are lucky. You are the first one to enter this library since I've
been living here.\) 

A combination of letters was overflowing behind the three beings.

\[Welcome, new librarian Yoo Sangah.\]

Yoo Sangah looked around. Dim light from candles illuminated the darkness
everywhere.

Library... There was an incredible number of bookshelves filled with books that
didn't seem to end. It had been a long time since she saw a library of this
size.

Kim Dokja's words popped into her mind. If she could live again, was she
willing to read books that weren't from those authors?

...Was this what he meant? She didn't know what this place was. She didn't know
why Kim Dokja sent her here or what he wanted. Still, she had a hunch. If she
read these books now, she might be able to solve many of her questions.

 \(Will you read it?\) 

\(Yes?\) 

 \(If you read it, you might be sorry. It might be a truth you can't
handle.\) 

Yoo Sangah's hand stopped as she approached the book. It wasn't because of
Nirvana's words. It was because a man she knew well showed up in the darkness.

"She won't be a librarian."

Kim Dokja was there.

  

* * *

  

 \(...Dokja-ssi?\) 

I felt deep relief the moment I saw Yoo Sangah staring at me blankly. It was a
success. Somehow, I succeeded in preserving Yoo Sangah's soul. Her soul body
was still damaged but the power flowing faintly through the library was
restoring her soul.

I bowed to Yoo Sangah. "I'm sorry to have brought you to such a shabby place.
Please endure it a bit. I'll take you out soon."

\(What shabby place? Foolish man who doesn't know the spirituality of
truth.\) 

"It's been a while, Nirvana."

 \(How did you come here. The 'wall' shouldn't have allowed it.\) 

"I found a trick."

Nirvana's expression was unusual.

 \(I don't know what you're thinking but this is a really bad decision. There
is a reason you have the wall.\) 

"I guess so."

It wasn't talking to me right now but the Fourth Wall must be very angry
because of what I did. A sharp air current reached my skin and I could feel
its emotions. However, now wasn't the time to worry about it.

 \(If the wall wants, it can turn one or two librarians into the dust of the
story.\) 

"I told you. She won't be a librarian."

 \(What nonsense are you saying? If you sent her here then naturally...\) 

"I'll bring her out again."

Nirvana frowned like he heard something ridiculous.

 \(Do you think the wall will allow that? Even if it is possible, that
woman's body is already dead. There is no place to return when the body is
dead.\) 

I silently stared at Nirvana. Then Nirvana's expression became strange.

 \(Perhaps, you...\) 

He was now part of the Fourth Wall and might've read my thoughts. His lips
trembled as Nirvana shouted,  \(No\! Even if the wall allows it, I won't do
it.\) 

"Nirvana."

Nirvana would know. There were many types of 'attributes' in the world but
there were only two 'perfect immortality' attributes. One was Yoo Joonghyuk's
regressor and the other was...

"Where is your sponsor, Mandala's Guardian now?"

The first reincarnator. Now the time had come to meet the third protagonist of
the story.
