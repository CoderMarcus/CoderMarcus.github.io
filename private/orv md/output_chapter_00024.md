### Chapter 24: Ep. 6  Judgment Time, I

The limited random items box... According to the setting of Ways of Survival,
this was a coin item which had been sold as a limited edition in a past
'scenario'.

\[Ah, no, why is this thing here?\] The alarmed Biryu shouted belatedly.
\[I-I-It was banned immediately after release\!\]

According to the original Ways of Survival, the setting of this item was quite
complicated. This coin item had been released long before the 8612 Planetary
scenarios began. It was a product which had been forcefully banned by the Star
Stream Administration Bureau.

If sub-items were put in, it would 'unconditionally' spit out a top item. This
would have a tremendous impact on the balance of the scenarios. Additionally,
the price of one item box was a huge one million coins. The constellations had
been angered by this ridiculous billing policy, so the stupid dokkaebi who
invented this item got fired from the Administration Bureau.

\[C-Constellations. It is like this... I don't know why it is here... H-Hihihit\!
Broadcast end\!\]

\[\#BI-7623 channel has closed temporarily.\]

The delirious sounding Biryu closed the channel, and the voices of the
constellations disappeared. I regretted not being able to see the reactions of
the constellations, but it couldn't be helped. I looked down at the vibrating
box. The random draw was about to start in earnest.

\[A sword type item will be awarded for putting in the same type of items\!\]

\[The random draw has started\!\]

The limited edition random item box randomly spat out items of a higher rank
related to the item you put in. There was a chance for anything from a C-grade
to an SSS-grade item to emerge. In the end, it was all up to chance.

\[The offered items are related to a certain constellation\!\]

\[The probability that an item associated with this constellation will appear
is greatly increased.\]

'...Eh?'

It was an unexpected message, but it didn't seem to be a disadvantage for me.
Both my hands were sweating. I hadn't been so nervous when I bought a random
chance item in an online game.

'Please let it be an A-rating'.

\[A top-rated item has appeared\!\]

\[The number of available random item boxes is 0.\]

The box soon stopped trembling, and the faint light subsided. Then I looked
around at Yoo Sangah and Lee Gilyoung, whose eyes were shining.

"Shall we open it?"

"Yes\!"

We opened the box.

"W-Wow\!" Lee Gilyoung was so surprised that he screamed.

By the way, it really was amazing. With a luxurious silver guard and a white
blade... Its shape was somewhat similar to Broken Faith? I immediately checked
the item information.

\[Item Information\]

Name: Unbroken Faith

Rating: Star Relic

Description: In the past, it was the sword of the hero 'Kaizenix', who led the
Grusiad during the Great Demon Age. The great ether dominance of Kaizenix
allowed him to create a 'Blade of Faith' that contained fire, darkness and
divine power respectively.

As an additional option, it increases strength and physique level by 2.

I was speechless. No... was this real? It wasn't a simple alphabet rating but a
star relic item?

"D-Dokja-ssi\! Doesn't it look like a huge item?"

It really was a huge item.

In the world of Ways of Survival, the 'star relics' were the only items
excluded from the ratings table. It wasn't just because they had a strong
performance but because these items were special.

Every star relic contained the power of a living constellation. The difference
in performance varied depending on whether the constellation was the hero of a
certain world and how much awareness they had. Regardless, they contained the
power of a constellation, so the relics had tremendous value.

Furthermore, it raised the level of my strength and physique by 2. When taking
into account that A-grade items increased the total stats value by 1, this
must be at least an S-grade item. Yoo Joonghyuk had yet to obtain an item like
this.

I looked around at Yoo Sangah and Lee Gilyoung. "...Can I really have it?"

"Of course. It naturally belongs to Dokja-ssi," Yoo Sangah responded in
advance to his repeated question. Lee Gilyoung also nodded eagerly. I looked
at Han Myungoh, but he was just eating the leg of a ground rat with a stupid
expression while muttering unknown things to himself. I thought he would
insist on having the item... It was strange.

\[You have acquired a star relic.\]

\[The owner of the star relic is curious about you.\]

The message showed that the constellation existed somewhere. Later, I would
open up Ways of Survival and look for it.

"Then we should go back. There are plenty of ground rats out there, so we can
go back with just the Magic Power Stove."

"By the way, how do we get back?"

"It won't be a problem to leave with Gilyoung's power. Use Diverse
Communication and..."

However, Lee Gilyoung's expression wasn't bright. "Hyung, I..."

"Huh?"

"There aren't any insects nearby."

Come to think of it, the insects around here had burst from the pressure when
I was fighting the dark keeper. It was a problem I hadn't thought about.
"There really isn't one? Some of them should still be alive. If we move for a
bit and use the ability..."

There were so many insects in the world that I didn't have any sympathy for
the few who died, but Lee Gilyoung still had a dark expression.

"Well, there is one I can actually call..." Lee Gilyoung closed his eyes and
started concentrating.

"Dokja-ssi, isn't this a bit strange?"

Lee Gilyoung's eyes were gradually losing focus. Then blood flowed down from
his nose.

"Gilyoung?"

All of a sudden, there was a loud vibration from above them. Dust started
falling down. The vibration was coming from aboveground...

At this moment, goosebumps appeared on my skin.

"Gilyoung\! Lee Gilyoung\! Wake up\!"

"Yeah... hyung?" Lee Gilyoung's eyes returned to normal.

"Gilyoung, stop the skill\! Quickly\!"

The surprised Lee Gilyoung stopped the skill, and the vibration subsided. I
sighed with relief.

There were incredibly dangerous monsters running around aboveground. There
were numerous high-rated monsters, including the 7th grade rhinoceros. Among
these monsters was the insect king. It was obviously a type of insect just
based on the name.

"You really..." I placed my hand on Lee Gilyoung's head and didn't say anything.
Gilyoung was about to call an insect king from aboveground... Was he Fabre? We
almost got buried here.

"For the time being, seal this skill. Don't use it unless I tell you to.
Understood?"

"Yes..." Lee Gilyoung replied in a sad manner. Now there was no choice but to
wait.

"We will get lost in the darkness. Let's wait a bit longer and move when small
insects appear in the vicinity."

It was easy to enter but the Edge of Darkness was a very dangerous place. This
was a place where someone could disappear for a day or two if a little mistake
was made. Then Yoo Sangah raised her hand. "If it is just going back, I think
I can fill in for Gilyoung."

"...How?" I was going to ask if she would converse with the Edge of Darkness but
stopped because it seemed sarcastic. Yoo Sangah replied in a slightly
uncertain tone, "I have a similar skill."

When I thought about it, I still didn't know Yoo Sangah's attribute and
sponsor.

"What is the skill?"

"That, it is a complicated skill to untangle..."

Untangle?

"...Excuse me, can I ask what Yoo Sangah-ssi's attribute is?"

Yoo Sangah wasn't a character in the novel, so I didn't know her attribute. It
was like with Lee Gilyoung and Han Myungoh.

"Uh, that..."

Yoo Sangah made a difficult expression. It wouldn't have been so frustrating
if I could use Character List on Yoo Sangah. I tried to use Character List
once again as a test.

\[The exclusive skill, Character List is activated.\]

\[This person isn't registered in 'Character List'.\]

Indeed... but there was one more message.

\[Currently collecting information about the corresponding figure.\]

'...Eh?'

It was a message that never existed before. Come to think of it, I heard a
system message when Yoo Sangah used the 'Interpreter' skill. It wasn't
something that was originally heard. Was it possible for the Character List to
be updated after some time? Perhaps...

I organized my thoughts and decided to let Yoo Sangah go. "Forget that I
asked. By the way, nice work. In the future, don't let other people know about
your personal attribute."

"That's not it\! I trust Dokja-ssi...\!" Well, Yoo Sangah's appearance said
otherwise.

At the moment, I got an idea. "Can Yoo Sangah tell me about the nature of your
sponsor?"

Yoo Sangah bowed her head. "I'm sorry."

The words barely escaped from her trembling lips. Based on this level, it was
possible that she made some type of promise in the contract with her sponsor.
Perhaps there was a life constraint in respect with the spilling of
information. I didn't know what sponsor they were, but it seemed they had
decided to raise Yoo Sangah in earnest.

"It is okay. I understand."

"Thank you, really..."

There was no need to thank me. The fact that she couldn't tell me about her
sponsor... made my heart tense. It was the desire of a reader who wanted to fill
the space between empty lines.

"Then try using your skill."

Soon, a faintly shining thread emerged from Yoo Sangah's fingertips and
started to stretch out. "In fact, I tied up a 'thread' when I got kidnapped."

One branch of the thread was connected to me and the other one was connected
outside. Maybe it was bound to Lee Hyunsung or Jung Heewon.

"Let's go."

There was no reason for Yoo Sangah to have such a skill from the beginning.
This was definitely the stigma provided by her sponsor. By the way, it was a
'thread' to escape the labyrinth. This... Somehow, I thought it was a
constellation I knew.

\[\#BI-7623 channel is open.\]

I started hearing messages from the constellations again.

\[A number of constellations have put a claim on the channel's transmission
system\!\]

\[The constellation 'Abyssal Black Flame Dragon' is curious about what came
out of the random item box.\]

Ah, they haven't seen it? What a pity.

\[Damn\! That bastard messed with my channel... Hahaha\! Did you stay well while
I was away?\]

The nice... No, a familiar voice was heard.

Bihyung.

  

* * *

  

\[...You did such great things while I was gone?\]

'Was it because of me that you couldn't come back?'

\[It... Yes, it isn't unrelated. I got a warning from the Administration Bureau
because the advertisement went on for too long.\]

Currently, Bihyung's voice was only audible to me. It was the 'dokkaebi
communication' that only the dokkaebi could use. Of course, it was an obvious
violation of the rules to allow me to use it.

\[I have decided not to care about small things now. And I can go back and
forth to the Administration Bureau. Rather... how do you know about the 'Random
Box'?\]

'Just, I found it by chance'.

\[Dammit. There are still remnants of the black history left. Why is that box
there...\]

'Black history?'

\[.\]

'...Wait. Surely that absurd coin item wasn't planned by you?'

As a reader of Ways of Survival, I didn't know this.

\[Damn\! If I wasn't greedy at that time...\]

Bihyung's grumbling was cut off by Jung Heewon's cry of admiration, "Wow, it
really is delicious\! What a surprise."

10 minutes ago, we safely returned to the rest of the party thanks to Yoo
Sangah's guidance. Fortunately, Jung Heewon and Lee Hyunsung had maintained
the boundary until we came back.

"You will recover a bit after eating."

"Well, I really think that my body is getting better." Jung Heewon seemed much
better as she swung her shoulders in a test. The meat of the underground
species actually contained detoxification components.

"Did you get a lot of things in there? In addition to the Magic Power Stove..."

I looked at Lee Hyunsung and said, "I got a few things."

Lee Hyunsung put on and removed the Old Steel Shield, which he received from
me, repeatedly several times. Now, he was polishing the surface again and
again. It was like someone with a new car.

\[The character 'Lee Hyunsung' feels a faint loyalty to you.\]

Jung Heewon seemed envious of the scene and asked, "Is there anything I can
use?"

"No."

"What is that blade?"

"It is mine."

"...Will you distribute the meat to the people?"

"If they have coins."

"But... you are really stingy. Kim Dokja."

"Let's just say that I have a strong sense of survival."

As we were passing around a piece of cooked ground rat, the tunnel ended. The
surroundings suddenly brightened, and people started to be seen. However, the
atmosphere was weird. What was this urgent and bustling mood?

\[There are 20 minutes left until the paid settlement.\]

\[Prepare the survival fee.\]

I belatedly noticed the time. That's right. It was already that time. It was
amazing that the word 'paid' could sound so scary.

"Coins, coins, please\!"

"I don't have enough coins\! Please, a few coins..."

100 coins wouldn't be a problem if they faithfully participated in the
scenario, but such humans were rare.

"I'll give you one million wonno, ten million won\! Who will sell 100 coins?"

The price of the coins was soaring. It was funny. There was a ridiculous
premium on money that had no value until the beginning of the destruction.
There were people who smiled as they watched from afar. These guys already had
enough coins. It was Cheon Inho and the Cheoldoo Group. A few women flocked
toward the gang members and cried out, "Y-You said you would give me 100 coins
before\!"

"Hrmm, is that so? I don't remember."

"What...?"

"I will think again if you will let me put it in one more time. How about it?"

Jung Heewon pulled out her blade and stared at them. "Those sons of bitches..."

\[The attribute of character 'Jung Heewon' is about to blossom.\]

The time had come for Jung Heewon. It wasn't bad if her attribute blossomed
now... Yet she needed some patience in order to get the 'attribute' I was
thinking about. Then a system message emerged.

\[After a while, the survival settlement will begin.\]

"S-Save me\! Please, help\!"

The expressions of the party changed. Lee Hyunsung bowed his head sadly, and
Jung Heewon bit her lip while holding her blade. Everyone knew what the price
of the 'paid settlement' was. There was no one here who hadn't experienced it.
Then Yoo Sangah looked at me. "...Dokja-ssi."

"Yes."

In this world, coins were power. A person with coins could obtain good items
or good stats. Coins were everything.

\[Several constellations with scenario recommendations have been added to the
channel.\]

\[The constellation 'Secretive Plotter' is watching your choice.\]

\[The constellation 'Prisoner of the Golden Headband' is watching your
choice.\]

\[The constellation 'Demon-like Judge of Fire' is watching your choice.\]

...And I was currently the person with the highest number of coins in the
station.
